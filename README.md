# Welcome to the data-structures-and-algorithms repository!

This repository contains various implementations of data structures and algorithms in Java, with a focus on understanding time and space complexity. The goal of this repository is to provide a resource for understanding and implementing common data structures and algorithms, as well as to provide examples of how these concepts can be applied in real-world scenarios.

The repository is divided into sections for different types of data structures and algorithms, such as:
- Sorting algorithms
- Search algorithms
- Data structures like linked lists and trees.

Within each section, you will find explanations of the concepts and the time and space complexity of each algorithm, as well as sample Java code that demonstrates how the algorithm works.

In addition to the code examples, this repository also contains information about big O notation and how to analyze the time complexity of an algorithm. This will help you to understand the performance characteristics of different algorithms and to choose the best algorithm for a particular problem.

```java
int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int sum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    sum += array[i]; // Time complexity is O(n)
}
